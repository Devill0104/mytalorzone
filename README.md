pros and cons of the project

pros: - 1 login , signup and signout works perfectly
2. resposive design 
3. authentication and validation works fine
4. options appear and disappear based on user is logged in or not

cons: 
1. add to cart and search are not working
2. the code base is not well structure (it can be resolved but little more time will be needed)
3. mvc can be adopted
4. .env was not used(it can be resolved but little more time will be needed)
